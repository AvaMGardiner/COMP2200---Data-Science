# Data Science Portfolio

This folder contains the files for **Portfolio 1, 2, and 3**.

## Portfolio Part 1

**Due in Week 10 but you will get your workshop mark for week 4 if you make some progress on this task.**

This is the first of three small tasks that will make up your portfolio this semester. For each one, we'll provide a dataset and some questions; you will work on these questions in a notebook that will become part of your final portfolio. We will set a date for you to show your initial work on each problem during a workshop where you'll get some feedback. You'll submit the whole portfolio for marking at the end of Week 10.

The first problem is based on a set of data on Steve's cycling races; you will compare data from four races recorded on a GPS device. This is an exercise in data cleaning, exploration and summarisation. You will select parts of the data, look at summary statistics and generate some plots. It is designed to allow you to explore and learn about Data Frames, the use of notebooks and practice generating a presentation around your analysis. Remember that what you write about your analysis is as important as the code you use to achieve it.

As with the workshop notebooks you'll use Github to manage your portfolio. You can get a copy of the initial repository via Github Classroom at [this link](link). Once you have your repository, check out a local version and start working. Remember to commit and push regularly to maintain a record of your work. We'll be looking at your commit history as part of the overall assessment.

For later portfolio tasks, we'll distribute the files for you to add to your repository.

### Feedback

You must show some progress by doing the first few questions of your portfolio 1 in your Practical Workshop Week 4. This will form the workshop checkpoint mark for this. You can get feedback on your work during the workshop. Commit your work by Sunday, 22 August 2020. We will review your portfolio repositories to track your progress on the portfolio 1 task.

## Portfolio Part 2

**Due at Week 10 but you will get your workshop mark for week 7 if you make some progress on this task.**

The second portfolio task asks you to work on some data about a Government sports voucher program to encourage kids to participate in organised sport. The task is mainly about providing a useful summary of the data but there is also a question about the relationship between the use of sports vouchers and the socio-economic status of the Local Government Area (LGA) they are used in.

Download the notebook and data files here:

- [Portfolio2.ipynb](Portfolio2.ipynb)
- [sportsvouchersclaimed.csv](files/sportsvouchersclaimed.csv)
- [ABS_SEIFA_LGA.csv](files/ABS_SEIFA_LGA.csv)
- [round1-redeemed_get_started_vouchers.csv](files/round1-redeemed_get_started_vouchers.csv)

Save the notebook file in your main repository directory and the data files in the files sub-directory. Once you have the files in place, add them using git and commit them to your repository. You can then start working on the task.

The challenge in this task is to present some useful information from the data in a readable way. There are a large number of sports and LGAs represented here so big lists of these will be hard to read and interpret. Plots of all of the data will be hard to read too if you try to label each LGA or sport. Think about what useful information can be provided to summarise the data. You will probably generate lots of tables and plots as you explore the data but not all of those should be in your final submission.

### ERRATA

Question 3 asks whether some **electorates** are over or under represented. This should read **LGAs**. **The file above has been updated**.
- **Question**: Are any LGAs over/under represented in their use of vouchers?

## Portfolio Part 3

**Due in Week 10**

The final portfolio task asks you to build a model for customer churn - when mobile phone customers leave their provider. You are provided with some fake data based on data from Optus. Your task is to build a simple predictive model and evaluate different feature combinations for the task.

- [Portfolio3.ipynb](Portfolio3.ipynb) - add to your main project directory
- [MobileChurnDataDictionary.csv](files/MobileChurnDataDictionary.csv) - save in the files subdirectory
- [MobileCustomerChurn.csv](files/MobileCustomerChurn.csv) - save in the files subdirectory

Download these files and add them to your Portfolio repository:
