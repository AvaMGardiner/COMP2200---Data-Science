# COMP2200: Data Science

In this unit, I was introduced to the fundamental techniques and tools of data science, including the graphical display of data, predictive models, evaluation methodologies, regression, classification, and clustering. The unit provided me with practical experience in applying these methods using industry-standard software tools to real-world data sets. Having completed this unit, I am now able to identify which data science methods are most appropriate for a real-world data set, apply these methods to the data set, and interpret the results of the analysis I have performed.
