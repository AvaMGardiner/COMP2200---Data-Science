# COMP2200: Data Science

In this unit, I was introduced to the fundamental techniques and tools of data science, such as graphical display of data, predictive models, evaluation methodologies, regression, classification, and clustering. This unit provided me with practical experience in applying these methods using industry-standard software tools to real-world data sets. Having completed this unit, I am now able to identify which data science methods are most appropriate for a real-world data set, apply these methods to the data set, and interpret the results of the analysis I have performed.

## Technology Used

For the Data Science Portfolio and Data Science Project, I used Python 3 for data analysis. This included a range of modules such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy that provided additional features. These were all installed via the Anaconda Python distribution. I used Jupyter Notebook as a way of developing and presenting the analysis results. This was included in the full Anaconda distribution.

## Data Science Portfolio

The Data Science Portfolio consists of three small data analysis problems that were given to me throughout the semester. These involved writing code to analyse one or more data sets. I showed the versions in the workshops for feedback and then submitted a final version towards the end of the semester.

## Data Science Project

In groups of 3-4, we were required to find one or more datasets and were asked to develop an analysis of this data and present a report. This project included using more than one dataset, cleaning and analysing the data, training at least two different predictive models and using the model to make some conclusions. The report was to be reproducible, all methods not only documented but available as an executable archive along with the data.
