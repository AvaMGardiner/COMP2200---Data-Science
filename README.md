# COMP2200: Data Science

**Overview**

In this unit, I was introduced to the fundamental techniques and tools of data science, such as graphical display of data, predictive models, evaluation methodologies, regression, classification, and clustering. This unit provided me with practical experience in applying these methods using industry-standard software tools to real-world data sets. Having completed this unit, I am now able to identify which data science methods are most appropriate for a real-world data set, apply these methods to the data set, and interpret the results of the analysis I have performed.

**Technology Used**

For the Data Science Portfolio and Data Science Project, I used **Python 3** for data analysis. This included a range of modules such as **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, and **numpy** that provided additional features. These were all installed via the [**Anaconda Python distribution**](https://www.anaconda.com/). I used [**Jupyter Notebook**](https://jupyter.org/) as a way of developing and presenting the analysis results. This was included in the full Anaconda distribution.

**Data Science Portfolio**

The Data Science Portfolio consisted of three small data analysis problems that I was given throughout the semester. This involved me writing code to analyse one or more data sets. I presented the versions in the workshops for feedback and then submitted a final version towards the end of the semester.

**Data Science Project**

The Data Science Project was a collaborative effort in which we, a group of 4, were tasked with identifying one or more datasets. Our responsibility was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the selected data and compile our findings into a report. The project necessitated the use of multiple datasets, which we meticulously cleaned and analyzed. We trained at least two different predictive models and utilized these models to draw conclusions. To ensure reproducibility, we not only documented all methods but also made them available as an executable archive along with the data. This way, anyone can replicate our work and verify our findings.
